// This file is intentionally left blank after Firebase removal.
// You can delete this file if it's no longer referenced.
// Keeping it blank prevents build errors if other files still try to import from it,
// though those imports should also be removed.

// Mock exports to prevent import errors in other files if they haven't been updated yet.
// These should be removed once all Firebase dependencies are cleaned up.
